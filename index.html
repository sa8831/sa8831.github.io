            reflects the brilliance found in learning, growth, and creativity.

        <h2>About Video</h2>
        <p>
            The "Shining Star," by Amelia Shao and Shamsa Alremeithi, discusses the thoughts of a student through drawing what 
            it means to be a "star." To others, its someone who achieves more and is extravagant in her studies. 
            However, from the main character's perspective, she believes a "star" is allowing herself to be her true self and achieve her dreams, 
            through her love for drawing, reading, and playing the piano.

        <h2>Stages of the drawing</h2>

            <p>
            Within the drawing, each stage of the piece is a symbolic milestone in the main character’s journey: 
            the ribbons represent the flow of creative energy that continuously propels her forward; 
            the papers emblazoned with an A+ capture her dream of achieving success and realizing goals can be achieved through focusing on strengths; 
            and the evolving layers of the composition illustrate how significant achievements are earned through perseverance, hard work, and the courage to embrace transformation.

        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <p>
            This short film was originally intended to be a vlog to showcase a day of a life as a student artist in university, 
            however, the story was changed to the concept of “What is a Shining Star?” 
            The inspiration comes from memories of hearing the phrase “Star Student” throughout elementary and middle school years, 
            and how it was used to be defined by teachers as a “hard working individual” or “a student with high marks and attendance.” 
            However, I decided to define it as one who can thrive creatively, and is successful thanks to one’s strengths. 
            I learned that concept from a J term called Leadership and Innovation, 
            where my professor would emphasize how one can be successful through focusing on strengths and not weaknesses.
            
            The Arabic writing is used to emphasize on the main character's connection to her identity as an Arabic speaker, 
            which explains the shot where the main character takes a book on the Gulf.

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>
            My partner would write down all ideas as I discussed with her ideas from coding, to reading, to drawing. 
            Unfortunately, since the challenge was to make a film under 30 minutes, 
            most of the ideas were narrowed to having my main focus be on the drawing, 
            along with shots of a journey to grab a book from the library.
