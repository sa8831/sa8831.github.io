# Beryllium oxide (BeO) - Interactive Comic

## 1. Project Overview
Interactive Comic is an engaging and interactive website that brings a unique chemistry-themed story to life. The comic is about the developing friendship between two elements from the periodic table, Berrilium (Be) and Oxygen (O), portrayed as high school students. Berrilium, a toxic element that struggles to bond with others, reflects the challenges of feeling isolated. In contrast, Oxygen is a highly reactive element that bonds effortlessly. The goal of this story is to teach the audience about the importance of self-acceptance, friendship, and overcoming limitations that we impose on ourselves. By incorporating real-life chemical properties—such as Berrilium’s difficulty in forming bonds and Oxygen’s ability to react with almost any element—the comic not only entertains but also engagingly educates users about chemistry.
In the story, Berrilium (Be) is bullied in the classroom and feels lonely, envying Oxygen (O), who finds bonding with others easy. One day, Oxygen tries to befriend her during lunch, but Be, overwhelmed, shouts and runs away inscurely. The next day, Be apologizes, and they have an honest conversation. Be shares her struggles, and Oxygen reveals his vulnerabilities. Through this, Be learns to accept herself and her limitations, realizing her worth is not defined by how easily she bonds with others.

The comic delivers its message effectively: everyone has unique strengths and limitations, which we must accept first.
Each of our team’s member collaboratively contributed their skills to develop this project. The hand-drawn characters and interactive features, such as clickable pages, page navigation, and character animations, enhanced engagement and made the content enjoyable.
Overall, the project was an experience that made us challenge our teamwork skills, creativity, and tech skills. We are proud of the final product and believe it will inspire the audience, encouraging them to reflect on their self-acceptance journey.
