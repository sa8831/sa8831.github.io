**Project Name:**

“The Shining Star” a 30 Minute Film

**Project Description:**

The concept is that others believe that one who is a “star” is one who achieves more and is extravagant in her studies. However, within the movie, the concept can be seen as one who believes they can be her true self and achieve their dreams, through their strengths. In that case, the main character’s strength involves her love for drawing, reading, and playing the piano.

**Process:**

The inspiration comes from memories of hearing the phrase “Star Student” throughout elementary and middle school years, and how it was used to be defined by teachers as a “hard working individual” or “a student with high marks and attendance.” However, I decided to define it as one who can thrive creatively, and is successful thanks to one’s strengths. I learned that concept from a J-term called “Leadership and Innovation”, since my professor would emphasize how one can be successful through focusing on strengths and not weaknesses. 

The Arabic writing is used to emphasize on the main character's connection to her identity as an Arabic speaker, and connection to the film’s setting, which is at Abu Dhabi. This explains the main character’s love for reading when in one of the scenes, she picked up a book where it discusses the Gulf. 

**Reflection/Evaluation:**

This short film was originally intended to be a vlog to showcase a day of a life as a student artist in university. My partner would write down all ideas as I discussed with her ideas from coding, to reading, to drawing. In other words, I would discuss with her hobbies that I have along with hobbies she have, and how to narrow it down to the ones that can be filmed quicker.  Unfortunately, since the challenge was to make a film under 30 minutes, most of the ideas were narrowed to having my main focus be on the drawing, playing a piano (at the beginning), along with shots of a journey to grab a book from the library to read.

It uses the pastel palette to showcase the mood of gentleness and calm that is an expression of the reflective and creative tone of the movie, and I decided to include slideshows to illustrate the evolution of the drawing to graphically represent the creative process and emphasize the theme of artistic growth. I also decided to include the drawings of myself and my partner to show the credits for the production of this film, while also keeping it minimal and simple for my website’s aesthetic.
