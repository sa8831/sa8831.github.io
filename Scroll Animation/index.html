		<p class="text">Carbon was born in the heart of a collapsing star, 
			the brilliant light of a supernova marking his beginning. As he emerged into the universe, 
			he realized something special—he was made of carbon, the most versatile element in existence. 
			His journey would take him across the vast expanse of space, through galaxies, and eventually, to Earth itself.

			From the moment he arrived on Earth, Carbon  could feel his presence everywhere. 
			He was in the air, the plants, the animals—life itself was built on the foundation of carbon. 
			His mission was clear: to understand how this element gave life to the planet and to help it flourish.</p>

		<p class="text">As Carbon Boy traveled through forests, oceans, and the atmosphere, he realized something vital. 
			Carbon wasn’t just a part of living creatures—he was the key to the entire cycle of life. 
			From the trees that captured him during photosynthesis to the animals that consumed the plants, 
			and back into the soil through decomposition, Carbon Boy was part of an endless cycle. 
			But this cycle was delicate.

			Over time, Carbon Boy saw that something was wrong. 
			The balance of nature was shifting. 
			Too much carbon was being released into the atmosphere, 
			causing the planet to heat up. Carbon Boy knew that this wasn’t just a problem for the Earth, 
			but a challenge for all life. It was his mission to restore balance, to help protect the planet, 
			and to ensure that the carbon cycle would continue smoothly for generations to come.
