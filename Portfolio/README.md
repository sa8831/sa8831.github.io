# Arcane Portfolio by Shamsa Alremeithi

##  Project Description

This project is a themed portfolio website inspired by *Arcane*, the steampunk action-adventure show on Netflix. It shows off four of my projects, all wrapped in a fun, interactive experience that flips between two totally different vibes: **Piltover (light mode)** and **Zaun (dark mode)**. The concept was inspired by my fascination with the contrasting worlds in Arcane. I wanted to create a portfolio that captures the tension between order and chaos, elegance and unpredictability.


The website includes:

* A toggle system using Piltover and Zaun logos instead of generic sun/moon icons
* Click-based visual effects (dots connecting in light mode and spray paint in dark mode)
* Custom silhouette animations of two characters as users scroll
* Embedded interactive projects with hover effects


##  Process

1. Created a single-page website structure (`index.html`)
2. Coded light/dark mode toggling with `script.js`
3. Applied custom styles in `styles.css`, including background animations and silhouettes
4. Used click event listeners for decorative effects
5. Embedded my actual project iframes from GitHub Pages
7. Tweaked layout and spacing to ensure accessibility and mobile-friendliness

To simplify things and avoid GitHub Pages loading issues, I decided to place all project files (images, fonts, audio, code) in one directory. This avoided file path disruptions and allowed for smoother previewing.

## Reflection & Evaluation


I was able to use everything I've been learning from the course, from creating visual themes to using JavaScript in this project. With light and dark modes that each have their own music, mood, and images, it feels incredibly immersive, which is one of its greatest advantages. I'm particularly pleased with the interactive elements that contribute to the Arcane style, such as the click effects and silhouettes.

However, in addition to smoothing out some of the animations and possibly allowing visitors to switch between more than just the theme, I would like to make the website more mobile-friendly.
