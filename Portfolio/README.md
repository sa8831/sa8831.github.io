# _Arcane_-Inspired Portfolio by Shamsa Alremeithi

## üé® Project Description

This project is a themed portfolio website inspired by _Arcane_, the steampunk action-adventure show on Netflix. I am inspired by the show's chaotic, vibrant, and unpredictable world of **Zaun**, a dystopian city in the underground where people are rebellious, so I used that concept to put together the website where it shows the background of the undercity, with transparent doodles (from the show) floating.


### Core Features:

-  **Cursor-based paintbrush trail** in bright Zaun-inspired colors
-  **Floating doodles** that reposition randomly each visit
-  **Project previews** with overlay text and call-to-action prompts
-  *Mood-based design* (dark only ‚Äî this version focuses entirely on Zaun)

## üõ†Ô∏è Process

1. Structured layout using semantic HTML (`index.html`)
2. Styled the interface with custom CSS (`styles.css`) including hover overlays, animations, and themed visuals
3. Wrote JavaScript (`script.js`) to:
   - Add animated paintbrush effects
   - Randomize floating doodle positions
   - Handle cursor tracking for paint strokes
4. Compressed all assets (images, fonts, and previews) into one directory for simplicity and reliability across GitHub Pages

## üí≠ Reflection

This portfolio was a chance to create something personal, messy, and expressive. It reflects both my skills in HTML/CSS/JS and my interest in worldbuilding through design. The combination of paint trails, floating visuals, and animated overlays helped transform what could‚Äôve been a basic site into something playful and emotionally charged.

If I were to improve the site further, I‚Äôd:
- Enhance mobile responsiveness and add gesture support
- Introduce more animated states for the doodles
- Add silouettes of the show's characters
