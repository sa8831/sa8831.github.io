                The video concept involves a classroom environment, following the experience of sitting for an important test and achieving mixed outcomes based on the responses of the audience. The theme was one of student life, academic pressure, choice, and consequences, written in a light-hearted, real-world style. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The experience had to be interactive, allowing the audience to engage with the story by engaging with a decision point in the video and viewing the consequences of their choices to cheat. The website itself was also designed to fit this theme, including a school-like aesthetic and interactivity that would be intuitive and fun so that the navigation could be intuitive and fun.
