# The Final Exam - A Short Film

## Project Description
The video concept involves a classroom environment, following the experience of sitting for an important test and achieving mixed outcomes based on the responses of the audience.  
The theme was one of student life, academic pressure, choice, and consequences, written in a light-hearted, real-world style.  
The experience had to be interactive, allowing the audience to engage with the story by making decisions in the video and seeing the consequences of their choices to cheat.  
The website itself was designed to fit this theme, featuring a school-like aesthetic and interactive elements that made navigation intuitive and fun.

## Process
We began the project with brainstorming immediately after assignment. The team debated several storylines before agreeing on a familiar, comedic one based on a student's final exam day.  
A complete storyboard detailing each scene was created, including an interactive section where the viewer could guess what happened to the student.  
Team roles were distributed efficiently:
- Two members focused on story development and editing.
- One member built the website.
- Another documented the project.

Planning also included:
- Choosing shooting locations around campus.
- Setting up necessary technical equipment.

Throughout the project, we used a variety of equipment and tools:
- **Recording Equipment:** Camera gear borrowed from the library to ensure high video quality.
- **Design Tools:** Canva and drawing apps for visual content like banners, buttons, and layout designs.
- **Collaboration Tools:** Google Drive for sharing documents, photos, and videos.

Filming involved capturing scenes in a classroom setting to bring the story to life.  
Additional clips, including bloopers and interview-style sitcom segments, were also recorded for a "Behind the Scenes" section.  
While filming, the website was developed with:
- **HTML** to host the interactive video.
- **CSS** for styling and creating a school-like atmosphere.
- **Custom Media Assets** like banners, images, and buttons.

Post-production involved:
- Smoother scene transitions.
- Adding sound effects.
- Incorporating the interactive decision point into the video.

By the final stages, we combined the video, web programming, and project documentation into one cohesive, interactive website.

## Final Outcome and Reflection
Overall, the final website closely aligned with our concept of a comedic portrayal of a student's final exam day with a focus on the choice to cheat.  
The film successfully portrayed the intended storyline with humor and relatability while incorporating some tense scenes to maintain viewer engagement.

Despite unexpected challenges with equipment and website building, the group adapted and completed the film and website on time.  
The addition of bloopers and behind-the-scenes footage enhanced the final product, making the experience more dynamic.

Through this project, we learned the importance of flexibility and teamwork in creative projects.  
Although not everything went exactly as planned, the final website reflected the collaborative effort and creative thinking that shaped the project from beginning to end.
