# üåç The Treasure Trail Across Borders

## üìú Project Description

**The Treasure Trail Across Borders** is an online interactive treasure hunt guided by a pirate character who travels across various countries in search of hidden treasure. Users begin in the **UAE** and journey through **Pakistan**, **Spain**, and **France**, uncovering **audio clues** that guide them to the next destination. Each section features a unique **soundscape**, blending local language recordings with ambient sounds to create an immersive cultural and adventurous experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Process

The project began as an idea for an interactive map where users could explore different countries, each unlocking a distinct audio-based scene. We:

- Recorded **custom audio** for each location.
- Collaborated with fellow students ‚Äî for example, recording **Arabic dialogue** for the UAE section to provide the opening clue.
- Edited each audio clip (30‚Äì40 seconds) to **evoke the cultural atmosphere** of its setting.

Each country‚Äôs soundscape was carefully designed using **Audacity**, layering:

- Street noise  
- Natural sounds  
- Traditional music  
- Spoken language

These elements were combined to craft **authentic and evocative audio scenes**, allowing listeners to visualize the setting without needing visuals.

### üåê Website Design

We designed the interface to reflect the **global scope** of the journey. Key features include:

- An **animated globe** on the landing page symbolizing travel and discovery.
- **Interactive navigation** via clearly labeled buttons on the homepage and individual country pages.
- **Audio playback controls**, including a **progress bar** and **speed button**, allowing users to revisit or fast-forward scenes.
- **Subtitles** using `.vtt` files to support **multilingual clarity and accessibility**.

The visual design emphasizes:

- A **clean, intuitive layout**  
- **Centered content and high-contrast buttons**  
- A **soft color palette** that evokes wonder and warmth  
- **Consistent visual identity** and easily accessible controls  

### üß∞ Technologies Used

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** for web development  
- **Audacity** for audio editing  
- **.vtt files** for subtitles

This simple but powerful stack enabled us to focus on **narrative immersion** and **user interactivity** without external dependencies.

## üß≠ Reflection / Evaluation

The project successfully delivered an **engaging, story-driven experience** that encourages **cultural exploration** through sound and interactivity. Key takeaways:

- The use of **localized language** and **ambient sound** created an immersive, accessible user journey.
- Navigation was intuitive, and the storytelling experience was enhanced by thoughtful design.

### ‚öì Challenges Faced

- Maintaining a **consistent pirate voice**:  
  Each team member recorded their section individually, offering creative flexibility but slightly affecting character continuity. In future versions, we aim to **unify the pirate's narration** for smoother storytelling.

- Working with **multilingual subtitles**:  
  Syncing and styling `.vtt` files was a new challenge. With persistence and testing, we developed a **reliable subtitle system** that enhances comprehension and accessibility.

## üöÄ Future Directions

We envision expanding the experience by:

- Adding **more countries**  
- Introducing **dynamic audio clues**  
- Exploring **location-based storytelling** elements

Ultimately, this project was a rewarding blend of **technical learning**, **cultural storytelling**, and **collaborative creativity**.
