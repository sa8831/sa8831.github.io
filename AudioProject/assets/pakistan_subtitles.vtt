Alright, I made it. What now?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Hi, I'm a shopkeeper! You're not from around here, are you? 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Iâ€™ve heard stories about travelers like you. One of them left a note behind:

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
"Where bulls charge and music plays, The next clue hides in warm sun rays."

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Sounds like a place full of life, dancing, and old stone streets.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Heh, sounds like Spain to me!
